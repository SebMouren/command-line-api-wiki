Welcome to the System.CommandLine wiki!

Our goal: 

_Give your user's a great experience with your command line applications - while you do nothing or almost nothing_

To do this System.CommandLine contains three pillars of functionality: 

1 Parse command line/terminal input
2 Render output to multiple terminals (VT100, Windows Console and downlevel consoles)
3 Offer common operations via a pipeline, including suggestions, help, exception handling, and parse debugging
